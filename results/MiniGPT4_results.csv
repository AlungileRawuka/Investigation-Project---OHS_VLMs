This could result in injuries or fatalities, depending on the location of the broken glass. The absence of appropriate safety measures also puts workers at risk of falls, slips, and other accidents. Employers have a legal obligation to ensure that all safety measures are in place to protect workers from harm. The best way to do this is by conducting regular safety inspections and maintenance checks on all windows in the workplace. Additionally, installing window guards can prevent incidents from occurring, as they provide an extra layer of protection against accidents and injuries.
